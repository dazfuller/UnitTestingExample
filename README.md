# Example Unit Testing

This is a simple Visual Studio solution I've put together to demonstrate some unit testing methods. This makes use of
[Moq](https://github.com/Moq/moq4) and [FluentAssertions](http://www.fluentassertions.com/).

UnitTesting.WorkUnit.1, .2 and .Final along with the associated test projects take a simple Fibonacci method from reasonable implementation to a better implemented and tested solution.

UnitTestingExample and the associated tests are meant to demonstrate some testing methodologies.
